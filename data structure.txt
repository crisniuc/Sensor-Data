.mat file - is a 1x1 DataFile structure.
load 'dataFile.data' to get the actual raw data.

In dataFile.data:
columns 1-3 = acceleration X, Y, Z
columns 4-6 = gyroscope X, Y, Z
columns 7-9 = magnetometer X, Y, Z
columns 10-12 = linear acceleration X, Y, Z
columns 13-16 = quaternion real, imag(i, j, k)

The timestamp recorded in the raw data is not an actual timestamp, it is just a counter multiplied by 5ms, 
so it can be added manually (that is why it is not added in the .mat files)
