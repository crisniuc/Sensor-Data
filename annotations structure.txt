Based on the .mat raw data.

First, on each row, we have the peak index (row number in the .mat file) of each annotated event followed by the event name/class.
Then, on each row, we have the indexes of the first and last sample of each annotated event (except the synchronization/clapping events)
 followed by the event name/class.
